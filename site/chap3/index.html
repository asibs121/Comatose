<hr />
<p><em>Albania, 2026</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara had been walking home from the hospital for the better part of an hour now, her feet sore, her eyes were weary, but most unfortunate of all, her mind was shattered. She was worried about Viktoria, suddenly slipping into a coma for seemingly no reason. Viktoria had been lucky Lara was visiting her the day she slipped into her slumber, otherwise God knows what might have occurred. To make matters worse, political tensions were growing in Albania. They hadn’t always been peaceful, hell they’d been ramping up slightly over the course of the last few months. But last night, an assassination attempt made on President Prifti truly marked what could be a truly devastating uprising. Albania was by no means a large country, narrowing in towards 3,000,000 people in population. Lara was worried, because she knew that if the government fell, she and her family were at risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at the main entrance of her apartment, she stopped for a moment to look around. The short hedges that surrounded the building seemed slightly less green today, the leaves on the trees drooped, the flowers wilted, to Lara at least. Her building, normally a brilliant white seemed to blend in with the greying clouds above her. Sighing, she walked inside, dragging her feet as she made her way to her home. The floor was covered in crumpled newspapers, and the sheets on her bed were left unmade. The place was messy, she hadn’t been able to focus enough to clean it properly the last week. She still had a bed to sleep in, a roof over her head, and enough food to last at least two more weeks, do the dishes and she’ll be fine, she had figured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TV had been left on, and plastered across the screen was President Prifti, speaking about the attempt on his life yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The people who do not see me fit for power and go so far as to try and end my life will be shown no mercy. The people of Albania deserve better than to be intimidated by a group of thugs.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was of course speaking of the Black Hand. Formed in the wake of President Prifti’s election, the Black Hand has been a thorn in the side of Albanian politics over the course of his tenure, inciting riots, burning out buildings, and carrying out assassinations, or attempts at them. Seeing as Lara and Viktoria’s father worked under Prifti, this was problematic for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara had settled into bed, hoping to sleep the night away so she wouldn’t have to worry about her life as much. Just as she felt her conscious slipping into sleep, her phone rang. Tearing the sheets off the bed, she ran towards the phone, its ringing echoing throughout the small apartment. It was her mother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hello? Mom?” Lara answered, trying to hide the slight panic in her voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lara, I know I just sent you home, but you need to come back… It’s urgent” her mother said, obviously under a great deal of stress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll be right over, what happened? Is Viktoria okay?” She anxiously replied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Viktoria’s fine, but…” Her mother stopped talking as she fought back a sob. “Your father… Your father’s been shot Lara.”</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Tessere, 3046</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viktoria had her rifle in hand now, preparing to use it in case the demons got close. Her blood ran cold with fear, but she didn’t let it stop her from escaping what would be certain death. Scrambling to her feet, Viktoria and Uni sprinted, or floated in Uni’s case, away from the campsite they had built. Either way, this was troublesome, as the Demons would know that someone was here and alive. The world, as Viktoria would come to know, was terraformed in a matter of weeks to better suite the presence of Demons. Humans by this point had all but been wiped away from the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We need to find a place to hide, we are in no shape to fight any demon!” Uni said, her robotic voice filled with urgency. Viktoria silently nodded, and the pair began to make their way towards a former neighborhood. They were probably 20 kilometers from where Viktoria had woken up by this point, having traveled the vast majority of it within the past few days. They could see the former capital city of the world, which was surprisingly lucky for Viktoria given the circumstances, as it meant the chances of finding more resources. They sprinted into a house, finding the door broken in and the furniture torn to shreds. Glass shards scattered across the floor, the tiles in the floor either cracked or torn out by the Demons. Despite this happening weeks ago, the house looked as though it had been abandoned for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending into a wine cellar in the house, they found three bodies lie torn to shreds, dried blood splattered across the room. In that moment, this is not what surprised them. One of the bodies was a Demon. Dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s dead.” Uni said, analyzing the Demon. Viktoria covered her mouth, choking down the urge to vomit once more. She examined the dead being, finding it vaguely human. It’s skin was a burgundy color, bumpy, and covered in small horns across the skin. The being had no eyes, instead being reliant on its keen sense of smell and hearing by the looks of it. A glowing necklace hung from the being, barely scraping the surface of the floor. Viktoria cautiously approached the being, carefully removing the pendant from the monster. As she grabbed the jewel, a surge of energy flowed through her, she felt a surge of power flow through her. Her eyes flashed with energy, seeming to glow, she swore she could see the world around her as though she were a deity. She felt the urge to throw the necklace around her head, and in pulling the small chain around her hair, she felt the energy weaken slightly, but remain. Her eyes cleared up, and she glanced at Uni, who stared at Viktoria. Or was she speaking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Viktoria! You’re alright, good. You must be more careful! You can’t just wear any piece of jewelry you find, especially not one you found on a Demon!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I... I think it did something to me Uni. I feel less tense, I feel some surge of energy. Can you check and make sure nothing bad is happening, because I think this might have been what allows for Demons to be so unusually powerful. I almost feel like this may be the source of their might” Viktoria calmly said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re fine, I can sense that power you mentioned. It doesn’t make sense where it comes from, however. Try a few things, see what you can do with it.” Uni said, looking as relieved as a machine with a single glass eye can be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alright, here goes nothing… FIRE!” She shouts, pointing her palm at the wall. Nothing happens. “Alright, not magic it seems” she thinks to herself. She closed her eyes and focused, focusing on the power flowing throughout her body. It seemed to intensify, growing stronger each moment she sat idle. Snapping her eyes open, she found herself falling to the floor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ow? What the hell?” Viktoria, patting her side loudly said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You were floating! I can’t believe it, you were floating Viktoria!” Uni excitedly shouted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viktoria concentrated, trying the move again. This time, she felt herself rise from the floor, she cautiously opened her eyes, trying her best to maintain focus. She was about half a meter above the floor, her feet hanging idly from her ascended body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fire.” She said, once again pointing her palms towards the wall. A ball of fire appeared in front of her palm, and flew at the wall, flames quickly spreading then quickly flickering out. She carefully let herself float down, gently settling back on her feet. Grinning at Uni, Viktoria knew that she had found a change at survival in this dreary world. Demons may run the place, but not for long.</p>
