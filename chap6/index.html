<hr />
<p><em>Albania, 2026</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machines hooked up to Viktoria continued to beep furiously, pulling Lara from her slumber. In a panicked fury, Lara jumped up from the chair she lay in and slammed the nurse call button. Something unusual caught her eye however...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viktoria's leg, having shaken from beneath the hospital blanket, had a deep gash and appeared to be constricted. Despite the wound being deep enough to bleed, something seemed to be preventing the wound from gushing blood. As the nurses rushed into the room, Viktoria stopped seizing, and her vitals seemed to normalize. However, the constricted flesh released, and blood began gushing out, spraying the nurses in blood. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell..." One of the nurses shouted, as she fought to cover the open wound. "We need you to leave ma'am, we'll let you know when you can come back!" Another shouted toward's Lara, pushing her outside the room</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Lara could do was stare in shock, as the nurse shut the door in Lara's face. Something was seriously wrong...</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Tessere, 3046</em> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrambling to her feet, Viktoria tried sprinting away from the crew of demons now charging towards her. Some of the demons resembled the ones she saw before, vaguely humanoid with long, thorny tentacles where their arms should have been. Some seemed larger and more  stocky, nearly as large as a bull. All six figures posessed the skin covered yellow glowing eyes which seemed to consume her thoughts as she fought to escape. Before she could, however, a tentacle wrapped around her ankle, a sharp thorn piercing deep into her flesh as it began to constrict and pull her towards them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"AAGH!" She gaspedd out, wincing as the thorns dug deeper into her flesh. She struggled to move away, but she could only claw the ground beneath her, dirt filling her fingernails as she was slowly pulled back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon which had grabbed her pulled her towards its face, dangling her upside down from her ankle, until her face was mere inches from the demons own. Seemingly staring into her soul, it roared, nearly deafening the girl. Raising a tentacle, it moved to pierce her through the abdomen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it could, however, It lurched backwards, seemingly in pain. Viktoria tumbled to the ground, and scrambled to her feet to move away from the demons. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"RUN VIKTORIA!" Uni shouted, removing a bloodied object from the demons back before floating away from the demons. Viktoria, viciously bleeding from her ankle, was in no shape to move away from the demons in time. Drawing all her strength and focus, she pointed her palm towards the demons approaching her, and shouted "PUSH!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All six demons were thrown from their feet and sent flying through the air, colliding with structures in the region. One was impaled by a destroyed light post, and its glowing eyes faded away. One of the stockier demons went through a window, shatterring the boarded window before disappearing from view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktoria got to her feet and hastily limped away from the area before they could return. She knew they had to leave the area before more came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Much better than last time, I must say, but that leg wound appears to be an issue." Uni, hurriedly said, grasling onto Viktoria with its robotic arm. "Allow me."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Viktoria could question, Uni picked her up and pulled them onto the street. Descending into a manhole, Uni laid her onto the surface of a dried sewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck this hurts, oh god..." Viktoria cried, grasping towards the wound. Her entire leg was covered in blood, and the flow of blood was not slowing at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need to cauterize it now before it worsens. Bite on my arm, this is going to hurt a lot." Uni, reaching an arm towards her face said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biting onto Uni, she gasped in pain. Searing pain from the wound overwhelmed Viktoria as Uni used a small blow torch to burn the wound closed. It only lasted a moment, but to Viktoria it seemed to last forever, the burning sensation spreading through her entire nervous system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That will do, we need to move. We are hidden for the moment, but we must continue, they will search for us."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing to her feet, tears rolling down her face from the pain, Viktoria silently followed Uni. She knew this journey was far from over, and even with the pendant, it would only get more difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair slowly trudged along the sewer line, moving towards the cities edge. Given that the residents of the city were killed off, the sewers had long since dried out, leaving nothing but dust and a vile crusty substance which Viktoria dared not think about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahead, they heard shuffling, and the two stopped, silently listening for any clue what lay ahead. the shuffling seemed to stop, and for around five agonizing minutes the sewer lay in silence, the only sounds being distant rats scurrying away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the silence was broken by something screaming, and charging towards Viktoria. Uni lit up, flashing a blinding light towards where the scream came from. The figure ahead of them stopped moving, coming to a halt, and facing them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a human girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"W....Who are you?"</p>
