<p><em>Tessere, 3046</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viktoria's call to Lara was met with silence. Her sister sounded desperate, and while Lara could be the occasional drama queen, she was never one to show the genuine raw emotion she expressed through her voice. She knew she needed to figure out a solution, a way to communicate with Lara. Trying again, she focused as hard as she could, squeezing a tear from her left tearduct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lara please, tell me you can hear me, give me a sign!" She cried out, trying but failing to not speak too loudly</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bena winced slightly, fearing something heard Viktoria as she cried out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It might be wise to move Viktoria, perhaps a different environment would better suit your needs," Uni cautiously suggested, daring not imply that she may have alerted demons in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting her hands fall against her thighs, Viktoria pulled herself to her feet, careful not to move too quickly and tear open her leg wounds. "Fine, let's go. As much as this area might be safer than the surface, I can't imagine it being that way forever. Plus, there's not much for food down here."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bena would like to join us," Uni chirped, following the girl speaking towards Uni in her native tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktoria only nodded approvingly, as Bena followed behind the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd been wandering through the sewers for a few hours by this point, careful to exit in an area near decent cover. Pulling themselves from a manhole, the trio carefully moved towards an outlying forest on the outskirts of the large city. While many of the trees were dear or dying from the lack of sunlight piercing through the ashen skies, as well as the toxic substances which coated the topsoil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viktoria gagged slightly, stopping to catch her breath again. A familiar scent filled her nostrils, one of decay and rot. They slowly moved forwards, peering into another gorge in the earth, piled disturbingly high with corpses, most of which human. Despite having to remember the purged memory of her first day on Tessere, Viktoria saw movement in the pit. Demons were sorting through the bodies, inspecting the physique of the deceased. Many of the corpses were rotting, flesh peeling itself from the bones as the demons tossed the bodies aside. On the far side of the gorge, nearly a mile away, a bright yellow glow eminated from a crevice. A nightmareish scream echoed through the canyon a few seconds later, far louder than any voice could reasonably carry. It reminded Viktoria of the zombie movies her and Lana would watch as a child, but this time an actual fear reverberated through her veins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bena turned around and vomited, clutching a tree trunk for balance. The unholy sight of thousands of corpses proving itself too much for her. What snapped them from their shock however, was witnessing a being emerge from the crevice. Nearly thirty feet tall with six long, spider-like legs, the demon roared again, the torso opening from the underside as it crouched to consume a few of the larger corpses in the pile. Viktoria's primal urge to flee soon took over as she made a horrifying realization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was made of human flesh and bones.</p>
