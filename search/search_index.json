Instead of awakening in her cramped bedroom as she had done every day for the past 23 years of her life, she was instead lying on the ground in this cold, dark crypt, where the only light came from glowing mushrooms. Feeling beneath her legs where she lay, she felt the cool, moist moss coating the rock she lay on. Feeling the earthy, dewy life beneath her confused her even more than her being in a foreign environment. \u201cWhere in the hell am I\u2026\u201d she muttered under her breath, pulling herself to her feet. She found herself dizzy as she felt her way around the cave, feeling the cold cave walls. A feeling overtook her entire body, radiating from her core to her hands and feet- dread. Steadily moving forward, careful not to step into any crevasses, Viktoria made her way through the dark cave, carefully tiptoeing through the hole she had found herself in. Ahead, a glare of rusty red light shone through what looked to be an opening in the cave. Not a big one, she might be able to squeeze her body through the gap. As she drew closer to the wall, a smoky, rotten scent overtook her nostrils, and she began to gag and cough at the stench. Peering through the gap, she could see outside the cave now. A sky full of rumbling storms were cast overhead a forest of what appeared to be burning trees, flames soaring for what seemed like kilometers into the sky. Viktoria pulled herself up and into the nook, barely squeezing her slim body through the narrow gap. Poking her head through, she dropped below, a two-meter drop by her best estimates. It was here where she got her first full glimpse of the world she had entered. Ancient ruins, seemingly thousands of years old still stand tall, dominating the horizon just out of reach from the cave. The air was still hazy, ashes flying everywhere as she began to trek across the rust red grass patches. She couldn\u2019t tell whether that was the natural color or if it had all been killed and stained it the blood red color it currently possessed. \u201cWhat\u2026 the hell\u2026\u201d She gasped, her fear once again sweeping over her. A massive canyon separated her from the towering castle on the horizon, a canyon that seemed to go on forever. The rotten scent became unbearably thick, almost overpowering her lungs from the fumes. A deep, sickening feeling filled her gut as she inhaled the sickly, smoky air. She proceeded forwards, peering over the edge of the canyon. Bodies. Hundreds of thousands of decomposing bodies were thrown around like ragdolls across the massive canyon. Many of which had been decomposed beyond recognition, seemingly been left to rot for weeks. \u201cNo\u2026 No no no no WHAT THE FUCK I\u2026I\u2026\u201d She broke down, her legs collapsing beneath her at the horrendous sight. Clawing as far from the canyon as she could, she shook violently. Convulsing from fear, she vomited, sobbing in between hurls. She slowly crawled away from the sight, back towards her cave where she leaned up against the stone and sobbed. Her cries were muffled by thunderous roars of an oncoming storm. The sun, or suns rather began to set in the horizon. She knew she had to get to her feet and be strong, but the number of bodies strewn across the canyon, thrown violently into the stream that ran at the bottom, it was too much for her fragile mind to take. Her despair was interrupted by a slight buzzing, accompanied by a humming noise coming from the distance. Pulling herself up to her feet, barely keeping her balance, she grabbed a rock and backed away into a nook. The humming stopped, but the buzz drew closer, and eventually a floating mechanical orb peered at the horrified woman before it. Veronika screamed loudly, brandishing the rock over her head ready to throw. Before she could, however, two wiry mechanical arms sprung from the machine, and it held them up in front of its face as if to say it meant no harm to her. She lowered the stone, breathing heavily at this point. \u201cDack\u2019shuma?\u201d it had said, rotating as if to tilt its head. \u201cW-What?\u201d She stammered, lowering the rock slightly. It took a minute, but the machine finally responded, \u201cWho you are?\u201d It\u2019s voice was cold and robotic, but genuine as it calmly floated before Veronika. \u201cVeronika\u2026 Who are you?\u201d She stammered in response. \u201cAm Unit 312. You are aware, speaking extinct language?\u201d \u201cExtinct language? What do you mean? What year is it, where am I?\u201d Veronika dropped the rock and began to weep again, sliding down the cliff facing. \u201cDo not cry Human, Unit 312 is friend\u201d It spoke, slowly moving towards her. She didn\u2019t bother fighting, if this was how she was to die, she wanted to just succumb to her fate already. Much to her surprise, however, Unit 312 merely used its mechanical arm to lightly scratch her back, instantly soothing her. \u201cYou are in Tessere, formerly colonized by Human. But now graveyard. Unit 312 was built by human, in last days of war. But hope was lost, as world was killed. You came from Earth, Yes?\u201d The being spoke, once again tilting its head. \u201cY-yes. Albania.\u201d Veronika hesitantly spoke, glaring into the glassy eye of Unit 312. \u201cAlbania? Albania fell thousand years back, year 2026. Human now all belong as one, all belong to Terran Union. Speak Terran.\u201d Her mind shuttered at this. Albania was gone? What sick dream was this? All of it was much too real to be a dream, the vivid scent, the rotted bodies below the canyon. Hell, even Unit 312 had been far beyond what she\u2019d be capable of dreaming. The future, had she been in the future? How would she travel forwards in time like that, it didn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cHow can I get home?\u201d Veronika asked, glaring into the eyes of Unit 312. Her tear-soaked face reflected off the glossy surface of the AI. She noticed her hair tangled and knotted. \u201cAfraid we must escape Tessere first. Then long journey, weeks. But demons not allow escape.\u201d Veronika got back on her feet, feeling nauseous, but slightly better than before. All she wanted was answers, and while she still felt sick to her stomach, she knew no answers would come through sitting and crying, as much as every muscle in her body wanted to. Unit 312 hadn\u2019t done anything to harm her yet and seemed like it wanted to help however it could. \u201cI think I need to find some supplies to survive, can you stay with me?\u201d Veronika asked the machine, which only nodded in response. Veronika smiled, wiping the tears from her eyes, as she walked away from her nook, Unit 312 trailing behind her. Maybe she had a chance after all in this strange world.","title":"Chapter 1"},{"location":"chap1/#chapter-1","text":"11/6/18 Tessere, 3046 Viktoria woke up, her hazel eyes darting across the ceiling; rather, where the ceiling should have been.

She had learned through Unit 312 however that this all came to a crashing end around a month ago. She was no longer in the year 2026, rather the year 3041. Humanity had long transcended from its cradle on Earth, soaring through the stars, forming a galaxy wide empire. The human population was estimated to be approaching one trillion individuals spread across the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, rising rapidly each day. Old Earth languages had long since faded away into memory, spoken only by a few stubborn rural areas of the most isolated colonies in the galaxy. However, 10 years ago, Humanity had awoken something, a race only known as Demons. Despite the vastness of the galaxy, this was humanities first encounter with intelligent life beyond that of their own making. A far-off world in the Large Magellanic Cloud, known to many as Golgotha, a barren red desert with small patches of lifeforms scattered across the wasteland. Ruined cities, hundreds of thousands of years old were scattered across the world. When the first Human colony ships had landed, the skies quickly blackened and red tinted skies overtook the region. As the settlers tried to escape, their ships were sent hurtling into the mountains, seemingly possessed by paranormal forces. The last survivors sent a transmission warning never to return to the world, documenting what had happened. Before the transmission ended, loud screams, emanating from a creature, a demon, bellowed, as the last of the colonists were quickly slaughtered. Viktoria had spent the last week learning of all this information, aided by Unit 312. Uni, her nickname for Unit 312, had been learning to speak Albanian more fluently, picking up on Viktoria\u2019s mannerisms and structure. The distant castle beyond the deathly canyon had been stocked with food, and as she discovered was the centerpiece of a theme park. A small military base located a block away had supplies of armor and rifles, untouched from the invaders. Veronika had learned of Uni\u2019s past, constructed about 5 years ago to interact and help Tesserians in the event of a demon invasion. The invasion came, but it was far too massive for Uni and her fellow AI\u2019s to contain. Millions of people were killed in the onslaught, many thrown into pits such as the one Veronika had the misfortune of encountering. Veronika told Uni her upbringing, speaking wonders of her past, life in her home country, her 4 siblings and family. She wanted to see them again so badly, but she knew she couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Her life as a bartender was boring, but it gave her money so she did it. For the time being, everything was calm. No demons had been encountered, and Veronika had been able to scavenge for various tools, even a suit of armor she found. Steadily, she had been building endurance to run faster, farther, hit harder. She was preparing to fight for her life in an environment that no human had survived. The demons were capable of killing billions of people, but Veronika was determined not to be among them. From nowhere, the sounds of crying echoed from overhead. Deafeningly loud distant crying, almost as though the skies were the source of the despair. Her rifle made sparks as it dragged along the stone, Veronika holding the rifle in her arms with near perfect form. She had to give Uni credit, for a machine it knew how to train a fighter in short time. Stepping outside the ruined hut she and Uni had lived in the past week, she began to recognize the sounds. Uni began speaking, but she ignored it. Her sister. Those tears were her sisters. She began to speak, \u201cVeronika, if you can hear me, just know that we love you, we love you so much. Just wake up. Please\u2026\u201d Another voice, this time an unfamiliar one. \u201cGiven we don\u2019t know what had happened, we can\u2019t be sure of when she will wake up. Besides being unable to wake up, we believe she is perfectly healthy. Analyzing her mental activities shown she\u2019s been under a great deal of stress, especially the first few days, but\u2026\u201d the voices faded. \u201cNo, Lara? LARA! I CAN HEAR YOU! Please! Please\u2026\u201d Veronika screamed to the looming clouds overhead. More tears ran down her face. She had lost all emotions since the first night, and the pressing reminder than her family needed her left her shattered even more than she already was. She fell to her knees, dropping the rifle to the ground. \u201cVeronika, what is it? You must remain silent, they may hear you!\u201d Uni spoke from behind her. Veronika stopped, staring at the skies waiting for a response to her cries, but none came. \u201cMy... My sister, I heard her\u2026 I think, I\u2019m in a coma?\u201d She furiously began pinching herself, only to find that she felt every grasp at her own skin. If she wasn\u2019t dreaming, then what was that? \u201cUni, what is happening to me?\u201d She asked, staring into Uni\u2019s single eye. \u201cI cannot say for sure. From what I have learned from you, you aren\u2019t from this time, as your primary language has been extinct for centuries. Logically, you shouldn\u2019t even exist in this time period.\u201d Uni\u2019s words did not bring Veronika comfort, because no amount of logic could explain her being where she is. And even if it could, there\u2019s no reason she should hear her family weeping over her comatose body, back in Albania, a thousand years ago. Her mind tore itself apart for answers, but none came to her.

She was worried about Viktoria, suddenly slipping into a coma for seemingly no reason. Viktoria had been lucky Lara was visiting her the day she slipped into her slumber, otherwise God knows what might have occurred. To make matters worse, political tensions were growing in Albania. They hadn\u2019t always been peaceful, hell they\u2019d been ramping up slightly over the course of the last few months. But last night, an assassination attempt made on President Prifti truly marked what could be a truly devastating uprising. Albania was by no means a large country, narrowing in towards 3,000,000 people in population. Lara was worried, because she knew that if the government fell, she and her family were at risk. Arriving at the main entrance of her apartment, she stopped for a moment to look around. The short hedges that surrounded the building seemed slightly less green today, the leaves on the trees drooped, the flowers wilted, to Lara at least. Her building, normally a brilliant white seemed to blend in with the greying clouds above her. Sighing, she walked inside, dragging her feet as she made her way to her home. The floor was covered in crumpled newspapers, and the sheets on her bed were left unmade. The place was messy, she hadn\u2019t been able to focus enough to clean it properly the last week. She still had a bed to sleep in, a roof over her head, and enough food to last at least two more weeks, do the dishes and she\u2019ll be fine, she had figured. The TV had been left on, and plastered across the screen was President Prifti, speaking about the attempt on his life yesterday. \u201cThe people who do not see me fit for power and go so far as to try and end my life will be shown no mercy. The people of Albania deserve better than to be intimidated by a group of thugs.\u201d He was of course speaking of the Black Hand. Formed in the wake of President Prifti\u2019s election, the Black Hand has been a thorn in the side of Albanian politics over the course of his tenure, inciting riots, burning out buildings, and carrying out assassinations, or attempts at them. Seeing as Lara and Viktoria\u2019s father worked under Prifti, this was problematic for them. Lara had settled into bed, hoping to sleep the night away so she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about her life as much. Just as she felt her conscious slipping into sleep, her phone rang. Tearing the sheets off the bed, she ran towards the phone, its ringing echoing throughout the small apartment. It was her mother. \u201cHello? Mom?\u201d Lara answered, trying to hide the slight panic in her voice. \u201cLara, I know I just sent you home, but you need to come back\u2026 It\u2019s urgent\u201d her mother said, obviously under a great deal of stress. \u201cI\u2019ll be right over, what happened? Is Viktoria okay?\u201d She anxiously replied. \u201cViktoria\u2019s fine, but\u2026\u201d Her mother stopped talking as she fought back a sob. \u201cYour father\u2026 Your father\u2019s been shot Lara.\u201d Tessere, 3046 Viktoria had her rifle in hand now, preparing to use it in case the demons got close. Her blood ran cold with fear, but she didn\u2019t let it stop her from escaping what would be certain death. Scrambling to her feet, Viktoria and Uni sprinted, or floated in Uni\u2019s case, away from the campsite they had built. Either way, this was troublesome, as the Demons would know that someone was here and alive. The world, as Viktoria would come to know, was terraformed in a matter of weeks to better suite the presence of Demons. Humans by this point had all but been wiped away from the world. \u201cWe need to find a place to hide, we are in no shape to fight any demon!\u201d Uni said, her robotic voice filled with urgency. Viktoria silently nodded, and the pair began to make their way towards a former neighborhood. They were probably 20 kilometers from where Viktoria had woken up by this point, having traveled the vast majority of it within the past few days. They could see the former capital city of the world, which was surprisingly lucky for Viktoria given the circumstances, as it meant the chances of finding more resources. They sprinted into a house, finding the door broken in and the furniture torn to shreds. Glass shards scattered across the floor, the tiles in the floor either cracked or torn out by the Demons. Despite this happening weeks ago, the house looked as though it had been abandoned for years. Descending into a wine cellar in the house, they found three bodies lie torn to shreds, dried blood splattered across the room. In that moment, this is not what surprised them. One of the bodies was a Demon. Dead. \u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201d Uni said, analyzing the Demon. Viktoria covered her mouth, choking down the urge to vomit once more. She examined the dead being, finding it vaguely human. It\u2019s skin was a burgundy color, bumpy, and covered in small horns across the skin. The being had no eyes, instead being reliant on its keen sense of smell and hearing by the looks of it. A glowing necklace hung from the being, barely scraping the surface of the floor. Viktoria cautiously approached the being, carefully removing the pendant from the monster. As she grabbed the jewel, a surge of energy flowed through her, she felt a surge of power flow through her. Her eyes flashed with energy, seeming to glow, she swore she could see the world around her as though she were a deity. She felt the urge to throw the necklace around her head, and in pulling the small chain around her hair, she felt the energy weaken slightly, but remain. Her eyes cleared up, and she glanced at Uni, who stared at Viktoria. Or was she speaking? \u201cViktoria! You\u2019re alright, good. You must be more careful! You can\u2019t just wear any piece of jewelry you find, especially not one you found on a Demon!\u201d \u201cI... I think it did something to me Uni. I feel less tense, I feel some surge of energy. Can you check and make sure nothing bad is happening, because I think this might have been what allows for Demons to be so unusually powerful. I almost feel like this may be the source of their might\u201d Viktoria calmly said. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, I can sense that power you mentioned. It doesn\u2019t make sense where it comes from, however. Try a few things, see what you can do with it.\u201d Uni said, looking as relieved as a machine with a single glass eye can be. \u201cAlright, here goes nothing\u2026 FIRE!\u201d She shouts, pointing her palm at the wall. Nothing happens. \u201cAlright, not magic it seems\u201d she thinks to herself. She closed her eyes and focused, focusing on the power flowing throughout her body. It seemed to intensify, growing stronger each moment she sat idle. Snapping her eyes open, she found herself falling to the floor. \u201cOw? What the hell?\u201d Viktoria, patting her side loudly said. \u201cYou were floating! I can\u2019t believe it, you were floating Viktoria!\u201d Uni excitedly shouted. Viktoria concentrated, trying the move again. This time, she felt herself rise from the floor, she cautiously opened her eyes, trying her best to maintain focus. She was about half a meter above the floor, her feet hanging idly from her ascended body. \u201cFire.\u201d She said, once again pointing her palms towards the wall. A ball of fire appeared in front of her palm, and flew at the wall, flames quickly spreading then quickly flickering out. She carefully let herself float down, gently settling back on her feet. Grinning at Uni, Viktoria knew that she had found a change at survival in this dreary world. Demons may run the place, but not for long.","title":"Chapter 3"},{"location":"chap3/#chapter-3","text":"11/8/18 Albania, 2026 Lara had been walking home from the hospital for the better part of an hour now, her feet sore, her eyes were weary, but most unfortunate of all, her mind was shattered. She was worried about Viktoria, suddenly slipping into a coma for seemingly no reason. Viktoria had been lucky Lara was visiting her the day she slipped into her slumber, otherwise God knows what might have occurred. To make matters worse, political tensions were growing in Albania. They hadn\u2019t always been peaceful, hell they\u2019d been ramping up slightly over the course of the last few months. But last night, an assassination attempt made on President Prifti truly marked what could be a truly devastating uprising. Albania was by no means a large country, narrowing in towards 3,000,000 people in population. Lara was worried, because she knew that if the government fell, she and her family were at risk. Arriving at the main entrance of her apartment, she stopped for a moment to look around. The short hedges that surrounded the building seemed slightly less green today, the leaves on the trees drooped, the flowers wilted, to Lara at least. Her building, normally a brilliant white seemed to blend in with the greying clouds above her. Sighing, she walked inside, dragging her feet as she made her way to her home. The floor was covered in crumpled newspapers, and the sheets on her bed were left unmade. The place was messy, she hadn\u2019t been able to focus enough to clean it properly the last week. She still had a bed to sleep in, a roof over her head, and enough food to last at least two more weeks, do the dishes and she\u2019ll be fine, she had figured. The TV had been left on, and plastered across the screen was President Prifti, speaking about the attempt on his life yesterday. \u201cThe people who do not see me fit for power and go so far as to try and end my life will be shown no mercy. The people of Albania deserve better than to be intimidated by a group of thugs.\u201d He was of course speaking of the Black Hand. Formed in the wake of President Prifti\u2019s election, the Black Hand has been a thorn in the side of Albanian politics over the course of his tenure, inciting riots, burning out buildings, and carrying out assassinations, or attempts at them.

Viktoria peered across the yard, checking to make sure no demons knew of her presence there. All clear, she surmised, pressing onwards across the yard. As she approached the street in front, she observed the sleek, metallic surface. \u201cMetal roads? I know it\u2019s the future and all, but what\u2019s the purpose of that?\u201d she thought to herself, lightly scraping the heel of her boots into the weathered surface of the street. They pressed onwards, quietly emerging from the neighborhood. They\u2019d been lucky in that house that the only demon was dead, they couldn\u2019t be so lucky elsewhere. \u201cViktoria, I do not believe it is safe here, we should make our way elsewhere, so you can try and practice your\u2026 abilities\u201d Uni commented, turning slightly to face Viktoria. Viktoria thought for a minute, before responding, \u201cSo leave the neighborhood and go to the country somewhere, away from the city? Probably a smart idea, but we should come back around sometime, after all, I found this. Imagine what else we might find!\u201d \u201cThat does not sound wise, but we will see\u201d Uni says, pushing onwards towards the woods with Viktoria closely behind her. Behind them, the sounds of crumbling debris caught them both by surprise. Jumping slightly, Viktoria whips herself around, and sees two demons slinging themselves closer to her with each passing second. Unlike the demon in the house, these demons\u2019 eyes were glowing a sickly yellow color, their vile pink skin covered in what looked like scales. Instead of hands, they had what looked to be tentacles, which they were using to sling themselves closer to Viktoria and Uni. \u201cRUN UNI!\u201d Viktoria shouts, sprinting as fast as her legs can take her. The demons were too quick, they were catching up to the pair. \u201cThey\u2019re too fast Viktoria, we have to face them!\u201d Uni shouts over the screeches and bellows of the two demons. Viktoria slows her sprint, peering over her shoulder to see that they were now only 50 yards away or so. She stops and turns to face them. \u201cViktoria, what are you doing? We need to find someplace else!\u201d Uni shouts, but Viktoria ignores the AI form the time being. Her mind clears itself, and for a moment, everything around her slows down, seemingly immersing her into a state of slow motion. She points her palms at the two rapidly approaching demons. 15 meters before they reach her. \u201cShatter\u201d Viktoria yells at the top of her lungs with five meters left separating her from the demons. Just as one of the demons reaches its thorn covered tentacle towards Viktoria\u2019s neck, the two demons explode into a cloud of dust and crystalline shards. Viktoria\u2019s body is pushed backwards by the millions of pieces colliding with her body. Closing her eyes, she landed on the metal street beneath her. While successful in neutralizing the oncoming demons, she now found herself being blasted with glass-like shards of what once composed demon flesh. Gasping in pain, Viktoria felt dozens of the pieces embed themselves into her skin, as the rice-grain sized pieces cut deeper into her flesh. \u201cViktoria? Viktoria are you alright?\u201d Uni asked, cautiously moving towards the grounded girl. Viktoria, now slowly pulling herself to her feet careful not to place her already bloodied palms on the glass beneath her. \u201cTo be fair, I\u2019ve been better. Could use a drink after that though\u2026\u201d \u201cYou appear to be bleeding, it would be wise to seek medical supplies. I must say, there were likely other, less dangerous ways to dispose of the demons with your\u2026 abilities.\u201d \u201cWhile I\u2019m not a med-bot, I am capable of alleviating some of any pain you may be experiencing, as well as removing any foreign objects beneath your skin. To seal your wounds, however, we will need more sophisticated medical supplies. I believe that most homes in the region would contain such a supply crate, so yes, it is likely you saw a med crate. Let us make haste,\u201d Uni said, approaching Viktoria, \u201cFirst, we need to remove the crystals, I\u2019m going to ask you to lie on the street while I operate. Estimate it will take 10 minutes.\u201d \u201cUh, alright fine. Make it quick though, I\u2019d rather not be seen by demons while you\u2019re operating on me. Hang on, wait, would I be able to remove them with the pendant? I mean, I used it to convert flesh into crystals, and floated ma-\u201c Uni interrupted her, \u201cIt is best we don\u2019t experiment too much, especially given how inexperienced you still are with the pendant. I will keep watch while operating.\u201d As she lowered herself onto the street, Viktoria cussed out Uni under hushed breaths,\u201d Ass.\u201d \u201cThis \u2018ass\u2019 requires you to remove the pendant for the moment, Viktoria,\u201d Uni said, displaying what Viktoria assumed was the robotic equivalent of a smirk.

Stay tuned! Tessere, 3046 The night before had been a long one for Viktoria. Uni claimed it would take 10 minutes to remove the shards of demon from her skin, However there were so many that it wound up taking half an hour. A number of the small wounds needed to be crudely cauterized at the scene as they bled a significant amount. Viktoria, having settled on the wounds, began to feel the stinging pain all across her body as the hundreds of openings began to heal. She used nanogel, a fantastic substance that was particularily expensive to heal the major wounds, and so the bleeding had stopped. While she still felt aches across her body, it was much better than it could have been with medical tehcnology back in 2026. \"Good Morning Viktoria. I made eggs and bacon for your sustinance. Fortunately, this structure was still functional through a generator, and the refridgeration unit was still operating at peak efficiency.\" Uni said, bursting into the room like Viktoria's personal maid. \"Finally, something other than stale bread and chips to eat... Wait, since when did you learn to cook?\" Viktoria groggily asked Uni, rubbing her eyes as she adjusted to a seated position. \"Last night. I found a half burnt cookbook which gave valuable information regarding how to cook a number of recipes. I was lucky to have found it, as most people used digital copies.\" \"Jesus, I know you're a machine, but god you're a nerd,\" Viktoria laughed, accepting the breakfast. Within the hour, the two were on the move away from the city, or at least away from where they killed the demons the previous day. They had seen a number of demons roaming through the city, fortunately they were able to evade being seen for the time being. Viktoria had tested using the pendant some, and learned an extent of kelekinesis. Larger objects are much harder to move, and often require lots of physical effort. However, she knew she still had much to learn about the pendant and it's mysterious properties. \"Concentrate, Viktoria. Focus on nothing but the stone. Analyze every surface, every imperfection. See the stone for what it is, a building block of the universe. Imagine what it could be a part of,\" Uni commands, as Viktoria focuses on the stone before her. The stone, about the size of a watermelon, and weighing about 15 kilograms, floats in front of her, rotating around as per her commands. Finally however, as beads of sweat drip from her face and onto her lap, the stone tumbles, falling to the ground. \"Well, better than earlier, had it up for what, thirty seconds or so?\" She says, picking herself off the ground. \"Your timing has improved by three point eight seconds. A small, but suggestive difference. You are gaining more control it would seem,\" Uni responds, while zooming in to scan the rock. \"Curious, the rock appears to be emitting a small amount of energy, which was not present before being used. It appears to be dwindling as time goes by however.\" Before Viktoria could respond, a loud crack of lightning rung out above them. The vaguely red tinted skies hinted that somewhat normal weather patterns could occur, however Viktoria had yet to experience anything beyond cloudy, bleak weather conditions. It almost reminded her of the trip to London when she was 16. Only, in London there weren't demons from another galaxy hunting her down then. \"I would suggest we find a better shelter, it appears this weather system is rapidly increasing in intensity, and it is likely we will be experiencing hail within a few mome-\" Before Uni could finish, a golf-ball sized piece of hail struck the concrete besides Viktoria. \"Yeah let's go, shit!\" As they began sprinting towards a relatively intact storefront, torrential rain began to pour from the skies above, soaking the two in seconds. Viktoria called out behind her \"Come on Uni, hurry up! We gotta get out of the- OH FUCK\" 30 yards in front of her was a group of six demons, all turning towards the commotion. Albania, 2026 \"Doctor, what the hell's going on? First you said she suddenly has internal bleeding, and now she's fine? Without you even operating on her? Is that even possible?\" Lara, asking the doctor says holding back tears. \"I'm sorry, but we just want answers!\" \"As do we Miss Morena. We've never seen anything like this before.

She's in good hands. \"I'm beginning to question that\" Lara muttered under her breath. \"Do you want to stay here with your sister Lara? I'm going to check on your father,\" Her mother called to her. \"I'm going to stay. I think she needs someone here with her for a while. I might see if I can't get some shuteye too.\" Lara responded, followed by a deep yawn. It had been almost a full twenty-four hours since she slept. \"Alright. Keep your phone on you, I might need to call.\" At that, her mother left the room, leaving Lara with an uncontious Viktoria.

Stay tuned! Tessere, 3046 The night before had been a long one for Viktoria. Uni claimed it would take 10 minutes to remove the shards of demon from her skin, However there were so many that it wound up taking half an hour. A number of the small wounds needed to be crudely cauterized at the scene as they bled a significant amount. Viktoria, having settled on the wounds, began to feel the stinging pain all across her body as the hundreds of openings began to heal. She used nanogel, a fantastic substance that was particularily expensive to heal the major wounds, and so the bleeding had stopped. While she still felt aches across her body, it was much better than it could have been with medical tehcnology back in 2026. \"Good Morning Viktoria. I made eggs and bacon for your sustinance. Fortunately, this structure was still functional through a generator, and the refridgeration unit was still operating at peak efficiency.\" Uni said, bursting into the room like Viktoria's personal maid. \"Finally, something other than stale bread and chips to eat... Wait, since when did you learn to cook?\" Viktoria groggily asked Uni, rubbing her eyes as she adjusted to a seated position. \"Last night. I found a half burnt cookbook which gave valuable information regarding how to cook a number of recipes. I was lucky to have found it, as most people used digital copies.\" \"Jesus, I know you're a machine, but god you're a nerd,\" Viktoria laughed, accepting the breakfast. Within the hour, the two were on the move away from the city, or at least away from where they killed the demons the previous day. They had seen a number of demons roaming through the city, fortunately they were able to evade being seen for the time being. Viktoria had tested using the pendant some, and learned an extent of kelekinesis. Larger objects are much harder to move, and often require lots of physical effort. However, she knew she still had much to learn about the pendant and it's mysterious properties. \"Concentrate, Viktoria. Focus on nothing but the stone. Analyze every surface, every imperfection. See the stone for what it is, a building block of the universe. Imagine what it could be a part of,\" Uni commands, as Viktoria focuses on the stone before her. The stone, about the size of a watermelon, and weighing about 15 kilograms, floats in front of her, rotating around as per her commands. Finally however, as beads of sweat drip from her face and onto her lap, the stone tumbles, falling to the ground. \"Well, better than earlier, had it up for what, thirty seconds or so?\" She says, picking herself off the ground. \"Your timing has improved by three point eight seconds. A small, but suggestive difference. You are gaining more control it would seem,\" Uni responds, while zooming in to scan the rock. \"Curious, the rock appears to be emitting a small amount of energy, which was not present before being used. It appears to be dwindling as time goes by however.\" Before Viktoria could respond, a loud crack of lightning rung out above them. The vaguely red tinted skies hinted that somewhat normal weather patterns could occur, however Viktoria had yet to experience anything beyond cloudy, bleak weather conditions. It almost reminded her of the trip to London when she was 16. Only, in London there weren't demons from another galaxy hunting her down then. \"I would suggest we find a better shelter, it appears this weather system is rapidly increasing in intensity, and it is likely we will be experiencing hail within a few mome-\" Before Uni could finish, a golf-ball sized piece of hail struck the concrete besides Viktoria. \"Yeah let's go, shit!\" As they began sprinting towards a relatively intact storefront, torrential rain began to pour from the skies above, soaking the two in seconds. Viktoria called out behind her \"Come on Uni, hurry up! We gotta get out of the- OH FUCK\" 30 yards in front of her was a group of six demons, all turning towards the commotion. Albania, 2026 \"Doctor, what the hell's going on? First you said she suddenly has internal bleeding, and now she's fine? Without you even operating on her? Is that even possible?\" Lara, asking the doctor says holding back tears. \"I'm sorry, but we just want answers!\" \"As do we Miss Morena. We've never seen anything like this before. As of now, she appears to have stabilized, but we will keep a closer eye on her for the moment. Just please try and stay calm.

In a panicked fury, Lara jumped up from the chair she lay in and slammed the nurse call button. Something unusual caught her eye however... Viktoria's leg, having shaken from beneath the hospital blanket, had a deep gash and appeared to be constricted. Despite the wound being deep enough to bleed, something seemed to be preventing the wound from gushing blood. As the nurses rushed into the room, Viktoria stopped seizing, and her vitals seemed to normalize. However, the constricted flesh released, and blood began gushing out, spraying the nurses in blood. \"What the hell...\" One of the nurses shouted, as she fought to cover the open wound. \"We need you to leave ma'am, we'll let you know when you can come back!\" Another shouted toward's Lara, pushing her outside the room All Lara could do was stare in shock, as the nurse shut the door in Lara's face. Something was seriously wrong... Tessere, 3046 Scrambling to her feet, Viktoria tried sprinting away from the crew of demons now charging towards her. Some of the demons resembled the ones she saw before, vaguely humanoid with long, thorny tentacles where their arms should have been. Some seemed larger and more stocky, nearly as large as a bull. All six figures posessed the skin covered yellow glowing eyes which seemed to consume her thoughts as she fought to escape. Before she could, however, a tentacle wrapped around her ankle, a sharp thorn piercing deep into her flesh as it began to constrict and pull her towards them. \"AAGH!\" She gaspedd out, wincing as the thorns dug deeper into her flesh. She struggled to move away, but she could only claw the ground beneath her, dirt filling her fingernails as she was slowly pulled back. The demon which had grabbed her pulled her towards its face, dangling her upside down from her ankle, until her face was mere inches from the demons own. Seemingly staring into her soul, it roared, nearly deafening the girl. Raising a tentacle, it moved to pierce her through the abdomen. Before it could, however, It lurched backwards, seemingly in pain. Viktoria tumbled to the ground, and scrambled to her feet to move away from the demons. \"RUN VIKTORIA!\" Uni shouted, removing a bloodied object from the demons back before floating away from the demons. Viktoria, viciously bleeding from her ankle, was in no shape to move away from the demons in time. Drawing all her strength and focus, she pointed her palm towards the demons approaching her, and shouted \"PUSH!\" All six demons were thrown from their feet and sent flying through the air, colliding with structures in the region. One was impaled by a destroyed light post, and its glowing eyes faded away. One of the stockier demons went through a window, shatterring the boarded window before disappearing from view. Viktoria got to her feet and hastily limped away from the area before they could return. She knew they had to leave the area before more came. \"Much better than last time, I must say, but that leg wound appears to be an issue.\" Uni, hurriedly said, grasling onto Viktoria with its robotic arm. \"Allow me.\" Before Viktoria could question, Uni picked her up and pulled them onto the street. Descending into a manhole, Uni laid her onto the surface of a dried sewer. \"Fuck this hurts, oh god...\" Viktoria cried, grasping towards the wound. Her entire leg was covered in blood, and the flow of blood was not slowing at all. \"I need to cauterize it now before it worsens. Bite on my arm, this is going to hurt a lot.\" Uni, reaching an arm towards her face said. Biting onto Uni, she gasped in pain. Searing pain from the wound overwhelmed Viktoria as Uni used a small blow torch to burn the wound closed. It only lasted a moment, but to Viktoria it seemed to last forever, the burning sensation spreading through her entire nervous system. \"That will do, we need to move. We are hidden for the moment, but we must continue, they will search for us.\" Climbing to her feet, tears rolling down her face from the pain, Viktoria silently followed Uni. She knew this journey was far from over, and even with the pendant, it would only get more difficult. The pair slowly trudged along the sewer line, moving towards the cities edge. Given that the residents of the city were killed off, the sewers had long since dried out, leaving nothing but dust and a vile crusty substance which Viktoria dared not think about. Ahead, they heard shuffling, and the two stopped, silently listening for any clue what lay ahead. the shuffling seemed to stop, and for around five agonizing minutes the sewer lay in silence, the only sounds being distant rats scurrying away. Finally, the silence was broken by something screaming, and charging towards Viktoria. Uni lit up, flashing a blinding light towards where the scream came from. The figure ahead of them stopped moving, coming to a halt, and facing them.

Both had spent around half of that asleep, exhausted from the whiplash they had felt, running between Viktoria's mysterious coma and their father being shot. They had heard nothing from the doctors, and from the looks on doctors faces coming from Viktoria's room, they seemed every bit as perplexed as Lara had been. Lara had been awoken by loud chanting and sirens outside the hospital. Upon taking a quick glance, massive protests had flooded the streets, police had patrolled through the crowds, attempting to keep the protests under control. The crowds were persistent though, some individuals agressively shouting at police members. Nothing could have prepared Lara for the explosion at the base of the hospital however. Shaking the foundation of the building, a massive explosion burst through the parking garage below the building. The building held, but windows throughout the area shattered in unison. Lara and her mother instinctively covered their ears with their palms, holding them tight against their skulls. Unable to hear anything over the ringing, Lara gazed over the now-shattered window. Dozens of protesters and police now lay in the street, dead or dying. Stampedes of people running away from the scene, while an isolated few seemed to be relishing in the chaos. Before Lara could fully graps the situation unfolding on the streets below, her mother had grasped her shoulder, pulling Lara's attention away for a moment. She couldn't hear what her mother was saying, her ears still ringing. She could vaguely read her lips however. \"Veronika.\" Sprinting towards Veronika's room, Lara found herself sprinting past hospital staff, doctors and janitors alike who seemmed stunned at the explosion below. Her mother ran towards her fathers room, leaving Lara on her own. She observed nurses clumsily fighting to watch over patients and prepare evacuating them away from the structure. Her ears had begun adjusting to the chaos, as her hearing slowly returned to her. The first things she heard were gunshots on the floor below, shouting and screaming echoing the halls between shots. Arriving at the room, Viktoria remained in her slumber, her bed covered in glass shards and her ears bleeding as her eardrums were ruptured in the blast. Slamming the door shut behind her and turning the lock shut, Lara silenced herself and listened as the gunfire worked its way up the stairs. She knew they were after her father, but the assailants seemed to be indiscriminant in their massacre. She prayed her mother reached her father in time. Tessere, 3046 \"My name is Viktoria. Who are you?\" Viktoria repeated, slowly presenting herself in a less threatening manner. The girl only looked on in confusion. She looked young, maybe in her mid teens. \"Viktoria, remember you aren't from this time, there are no native Albanian speakers remaining.\" Uni said, facing Viktoria. \"Dack\u2019shuma? Maid've Viktoria ani Una 312. Masten'i Paes.\" Uni said, now facing the startled girl. She'd grown used to an Albanian speaking Uni, so hearing it speak in the modern language was unusual to Viktoria. The two conversed, and the girl seemed noticeably less stressed at the sudden encounter. \"Viktoria, you are likely going to need a translator to communicate directly with Bena here. Until we find a proper personal communication device, you can discuss through myself. \"To summarize Bena's situation, she was separated from her parent's at the onset of the demon invasion, and has been taking cover down here since then, rarely making trips to the surface for food.\" Victoria listened intently to Uni, but something else about Bena caught her eye. Bena's clothes were slightly tattered, with occasional tears revealing skin beneath her. Near her collarbone a tear revealed a golden shimmer.

She seemed almost ashamed she'd been caught with it, but nonetheless she presented it to Viktoria. \"I have one too, here.\" Viktoria said, carefully pulling her own from around her neck. \"Where did you find it?\" Seemingly as if she knew what Viktoria had asked, she pointed to the surface above her. \"Yes, that's where I got it.

Her sister sounded desperate, and while Lara could be the occasional drama queen, she was never one to show the genuine raw emotion she expressed through her voice. She knew she needed to figure out a solution, a way to communicate with Lara. Trying again, she focused as hard as she could, squeezing a tear from her left tearduct. \"Lara please, tell me you can hear me, give me a sign!\" She cried out, trying but failing to not speak too loudly Bena winced slightly, fearing something heard Viktoria as she cried out. \"It might be wise to move Viktoria, perhaps a different environment would better suit your needs,\" Uni cautiously suggested, daring not imply that she may have alerted demons in the region. Letting her hands fall against her thighs, Viktoria pulled herself to her feet, careful not to move too quickly and tear open her leg wounds. \"Fine, let's go. As much as this area might be safer than the surface, I can't imagine it being that way forever. Plus, there's not much for food down here.\" \"Bena would like to join us,\" Uni chirped, following the girl speaking towards Uni in her native tongue. Viktoria only nodded approvingly, as Bena followed behind the two. They'd been wandering through the sewers for a few hours by this point, careful to exit in an area near decent cover. Pulling themselves from a manhole, the trio carefully moved towards an outlying forest on the outskirts of the large city. While many of the trees were dear or dying from the lack of sunlight piercing through the ashen skies, as well as the toxic substances which coated the topsoil. Viktoria gagged slightly, stopping to catch her breath again. A familiar scent filled her nostrils, one of decay and rot. They slowly moved forwards, peering into another gorge in the earth, piled disturbingly high with corpses, most of which human. Despite having to remember the purged memory of her first day on Tessere, Viktoria saw movement in the pit. Demons were sorting through the bodies, inspecting the physique of the deceased. Many of the corpses were rotting, flesh peeling itself from the bones as the demons tossed the bodies aside. On the far side of the gorge, nearly a mile away, a bright yellow glow eminated from a crevice. A nightmareish scream echoed through the canyon a few seconds later, far louder than any voice could reasonably carry. It reminded Viktoria of the zombie movies her and Lana would watch as a child, but this time an actual fear reverberated through her veins. Bena turned around and vomited, clutching a tree trunk for balance. The unholy sight of thousands of corpses proving itself too much for her. What snapped them from their shock however, was witnessing a being emerge from the crevice. Nearly thirty feet tall with six long, spider-like legs, the demon roared again, the torso opening from the underside as it crouched to consume a few of the larger corpses in the pile. Viktoria's primal urge to flee soon took over as she made a horrifying realization. It was made of human flesh and bones.

If this is something you are sensitive to, read at your own discretion, otherwise skip to Lara's section. Tessere, 3046 Viktoria's call to Lara was met with silence. Her sister sounded desperate, and while Lara could be the occasional drama queen, she was never one to show the genuine raw emotion she expressed through her voice. She knew she needed to figure out a solution, a way to communicate with Lara. Trying again, she focused as hard as she could, squeezing a tear from her left tearduct. \"Lara please, tell me you can hear me, give me a sign!\" She cried out, trying but failing to not speak too loudly Bena winced slightly, fearing something heard Viktoria as she cried out. \"It might be wise to move Viktoria, perhaps a different environment would better suit your needs,\" Uni cautiously suggested, daring not imply that she may have alerted demons in the region. Letting her hands fall against her thighs, Viktoria pulled herself to her feet, careful not to move too quickly and tear open her leg wounds. \"Fine, let's go. As much as this area might be safer than the surface, I can't imagine it being that way forever. Plus, there's not much for food down here.\" \"Bena would like to join us,\" Uni chirped, following the girl speaking towards Uni in her native tongue. Viktoria only nodded approvingly, as Bena followed behind the two. They'd been wandering through the sewers for a few hours by this point, careful to exit in an area near decent cover. Pulling themselves from a manhole, the trio carefully moved towards an outlying forest on the outskirts of the large city. While many of the trees were dear or dying from the lack of sunlight piercing through the ashen skies, as well as the toxic substances which coated the topsoil. Viktoria gagged slightly, stopping to catch her breath again. A familiar scent filled her nostrils, one of decay and rot. They slowly moved forwards, peering into another gorge in the earth, piled disturbingly high with corpses, most of which human. Despite having to remember the purged memory of her first day on Tessere, Viktoria saw movement in the pit. Demons were sorting through the bodies, inspecting the physique of the deceased. Many of the corpses were rotting, flesh peeling itself from the bones as the demons tossed the bodies aside.
