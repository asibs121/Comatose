<hr />
<p><em>Albania, 2026</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara and Her mother remained in the waiting room for a full 6 hours at this point. Both had spent around half of that asleep, exhausted from the whiplash they had felt, running between Viktoria's mysterious coma and their father being shot. They had heard nothing from the doctors, and from the looks on doctors faces coming from Viktoria's room, they seemed every bit as perplexed as Lara had been. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara had been awoken by loud chanting and sirens outside the hospital. Upon taking a quick glance, massive protests had flooded the streets, police had patrolled through the crowds, attempting to keep the protests under control. The crowds were persistent though, some individuals agressively shouting at police members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could have prepared Lara for the explosion at the base of the hospital however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking the foundation of the building, a massive explosion burst through the parking garage below the building. The building held, but windows throughout the area shattered in unison. Lara and her mother instinctively covered their ears with their palms, holding them tight against their skulls. Unable to hear anything over the ringing, Lara gazed over the now-shattered window. Dozens of protesters and police now lay in the street, dead or dying. Stampedes of people running away from the scene, while an isolated few seemed to be relishing in the chaos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lara could fully graps the situation unfolding on the streets below, her mother had grasped her shoulder, pulling Lara's attention away for a moment. She couldn't hear what her mother was saying, her ears still ringing. She could vaguely read her lips however. "Veronika." Sprinting towards Veronika's room, Lara found herself sprinting past hospital staff, doctors and janitors alike who seemmed stunned at the explosion below. Her mother ran towards her fathers room, leaving Lara on her own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She observed nurses clumsily fighting to watch over patients and prepare evacuating them away from the structure. Her ears had begun adjusting to the chaos, as her hearing slowly returned to her. The first things she heard were gunshots on the floor below, shouting and screaming echoing the halls between shots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at the room, Viktoria remained in her slumber, her bed covered in glass shards and her ears bleeding as her eardrums were ruptured in the blast. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slamming the door shut behind her and turning the lock shut, Lara silenced herself and listened as the gunfire worked its way up the stairs. She knew they were after her father, but the assailants seemed to be indiscriminant in their massacre. She prayed her mother reached her father in time. </p>
<hr />
<p><em>Tessere, 3046</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Viktoria. Who are you?" Viktoria repeated, slowly presenting herself in a less threatening manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl only looked on in confusion. She looked young, maybe in her mid teens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Viktoria, remember you aren't from this time, there are no native Albanian speakers remaining." Uni said, facing Viktoria. "Dackâ€™shuma? Maid've Viktoria ani Una 312. Masten'i Paes." Uni said, now facing the startled girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She'd grown used to an Albanian speaking Uni, so hearing it speak in the modern language was unusual to Viktoria. The two conversed, and the girl seemed noticeably less stressed at the sudden encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Viktoria, you are likely going to need a translator to communicate directly with Bena here. Until we find a proper personal communication device, you can discuss through myself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To summarize Bena's situation, she was separated from her parent's at the onset of the demon invasion, and has been taking cover down here since then, rarely making trips to the surface for food."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victoria listened intently to Uni, but something else about Bena caught her eye. Bena's clothes were slightly tattered, with occasional tears revealing skin beneath her. Near her collarbone a tear revealed a golden shimmer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bena moved slightly, and Viktoria saw a familiar shimmer reflecting off the object, which slightly revealed a reddish crystaline structure beneath it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had an identical pendant around her neck to Viktoria's.</p>
