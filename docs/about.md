# Welcome to Comatose!
The tale of Viktoria Moreno as she fights to survive on a foreign world, one she fell into after slipping into a mysterious coma. All the while, her family must protect her from the revolution taking place outside their home.

I do not write chapters on a consistent schedule, as I write on my own pace. Also, I'm not a professional writer, and to be fair, I don't read anywhere near as much as I probably should.
