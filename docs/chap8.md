*Albania, 2026*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sirens echoed through Tirana Albania, as police, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles moved through the already congested streets. It had only been minutes since the explosion struck the hospital, and emergency services which had arrived at the scene already confirmed that over thirty people were killed in the explosion, and the massacre within the hospital. The assailants were still inside the hospital, and while the gunfire seemed to have stopped, no one dared enter the hospital to neutralize the terrorists. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara and Viktoria were still trapped in the room, and while they had evaded the assailants for now, it didn't take long before somene tried to force their way in. The chair propped in front of the door had held, thankfully, but it was only a matter of time before it was pushed aside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone's in here!" she heard from outside the door. A loud thump echoed through the door, followed by gunfire seemingly aimed at the door handle. A number of shots lodged themselves in the wooden door, but a number tore through, filling the room with dust and sawdust.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara screamed, and began frantically moving Viktoria from the bed to the floor. Viktoria's comatose body clumsily slid to the floor, sprawling out across the floor between the shattered window and the bedframe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, someone tried to force themselves into the door, kicking near the handle, and heavily slamming into the door in an effort to break it open. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Vladmir, we found him, get your ass over here!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye!" Loud footsteps pulled away, the terrorists boots thumping heavily though the hallway. While her ears still rung, she could still make out voices, all seemingly headed towards where her fathers room was located. As soon as they had faded away, drowned out by the sirens and chaos on the streets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Lara could do in this moment was break down, and cry. Silently sobbing, she spoke to Viktoria, "Wake up, please Viktoria, you're all I have left..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that? Around your neck?" Viktoria asked, facing Bena. Following Uni's translation, Bena cautiously pulled the pendant from her shirt. She seemed almost ashamed she'd been caught with it, but nonetheless she presented it to Viktoria.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have one too, here." Viktoria said, carefully pulling her own from around her neck. "Where did you find it?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemingly as if she knew what Viktoria had asked, she pointed to the surface above her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's where I got it. Can you use it?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Uni's translation, Bena dropped the hendant, letting it slap against her chest, before calmly summoning a small flame in her palm, which flickered out within a second.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viktoria closed her eyes, and imagined sparks from flint striking steel. "Sparks" She calmly spoke, as a few sparks emitted from her own palm. Bena softly chuckled, tension easing in her shoulders knowing that Viktoria was comfortable with her having the pendant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Viktoria, you're all I have left..." a voice spoke, fading in. Lara.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uni, i hear her again..." Viktoria gasped, looking around to find where the voice came from. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister? Don't yell this time, last time this occured you almost killed us both. Try using your pendant and think it to her. I am unaware of the full capabilities of it, but it's worth trying." Uni hurriedly responded, before Viktoria could blow their cover again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bena looked on curiously, feeling a slight concern for the strange girl whom she had only just met, as the girl clutched her temples to concentrate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lara, can you hear me?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lara's sobs cut short, as she felt Viktoria suddenly twitch, almost in response to her pleading a minute prior. Almost telepathically, a voice rang through her head.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lara, can you hear me?"
