# Welcome to Comatose!

Welcome to Comatose! A story project that I've been writing for some time now, whenever I care to work on it. I work at my own pace, so it might be a while between chapters. Please be patient, writers block is a thing.

## Summary

Viktoria Moreno, a 23 year old Albanian bartender finds herself waking up in a cold, dead world as opposed to her bed. Upon meeting Uni, an artificial intelligence built by the former inhabitants of the world, she learns she's been sent into the future, one which Humanity struggles to fight against extinction. Meanwhile, her family struggles to protect her comatose body from the revolution rocking their country.
