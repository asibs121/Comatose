# Chapter 5

**1/18/20**

*Kind of a laid back chapter where not much seems to occur, but it needs to happen to deliver for future chapters. Stay tuned!*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night before had been a long one for Viktoria. Uni claimed it would take 10 minutes to remove the shards of demon from her skin, However there were so many that it wound up taking half an hour. A number of the small wounds needed to be crudely cauterized at the scene as they bled a significant amount. Viktoria, having settled on the wounds, began to feel the stinging pain all across her body as the hundreds of openings began to heal. She used nanogel, a fantastic substance that was particularily expensive to heal the major wounds, and so the bleeding had stopped. While she still felt aches across her body, it was much better than it could have been with medical tehcnology back in 2026.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Morning Viktoria. I made eggs and bacon for your sustinance. Fortunately, this structure was still functional through a generator, and the refridgeration unit was still operating at peak efficiency." Uni said, bursting into the room like Viktoria's personal maid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finally, something other than stale bread and chips to eat... Wait, since when did you learn to cook?" Viktoria groggily asked Uni, rubbing her eyes as she adjusted to a seated position.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night. I found a half burnt cookbook which gave valuable information regarding how to cook a number of recipes. I was lucky to have found it, as most people used digital copies."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jesus, I know you're a machine, but god you're a nerd," Viktoria laughed, accepting the breakfast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the hour, the two were on the move away from the city, or at least away from where they killed the demons the previous day. They had seen a number of demons roaming through the city, fortunately they were able to evade being seen for the time being. Viktoria had tested using the pendant some, and learned an extent of kelekinesis. Larger objects are much harder to move, and often require lots of physical effort. However, she knew she still had much to learn about the pendant and it's mysterious properties.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Concentrate, Viktoria. Focus on nothing but the stone. Analyze every surface, every imperfection. See the stone for what it is, a building block of the universe. Imagine what it could be a part of," Uni
